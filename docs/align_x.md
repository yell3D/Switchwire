# How to align the gantry

## Square the gantry
1. Power off the printer and unplug the X & Z motors
2. Loosen the X & Z belts as we gonna move the tool head manually and don't want to fight the motor 3. resistance
3. Place 2 same size objects on the frame and put the X rail (not the extrusion) on it. use a somewhat leveled bed if you cant use the extrusions
4. Loosen the blocks connecting X extrusion and Z rails (the M5 screws), check if these left marks on the extrusion because they were to long
5. Press the X extrusion to the back of the printer and down on the 2 objects. Tighten the M5 blocks connecting X extrusion and Z rail again
6. Tighten the XZ belts until they sound somewhat like a guitar and roughly the same (dont need to be perfect). Do a little bit at a time on each motor mount.
7. Move the gantry up/down and left/right always going back on the 2 objects
8. Tighten the side with gap between rail and object or loosen the side sitting on the objects
9. Repeat last step until it both sides always rest on the object after every move of the tool head (move it up/down and left/right)
