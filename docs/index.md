* If you don't know, sell/trash the Ender and buy a cheap Trident (preferred) or V2.4r2 300 kit on sale

# Sourcing

The build in itself is expensive and may not as easy as you think. The current recommendation is to go for the Siboor kit as sourcing panels is a huge pita and really expensive.

You can find more information on [their GitHub site](https://github.com/Lzhikai/SIBOOR-E3-SW) and its available on their Ali-express site:

# Things i knew before

<img height="60" alt="If Only You Knew How Bad Things Really Are" src="../res/img/if_only_you_knew_how_bad_things_really_are.jpg">

* DO NOT BUY AN ENDER JUST TO CONVERT IT
* expensive
* its still a bedslinger, tho its a nice one and capable for producing fine prints
* huge footprint
* huge chamber to heat
* enclosure build and removal sux
* lose of Z height, worse with enclosure
